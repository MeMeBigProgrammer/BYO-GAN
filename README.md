# BYO-GAN

**A Work in Progress!!!!!**

As a part of my independent study for Junior year, my final project was to recreate StyleGan in Python using Pytorch. I used some notes from a Coursera course I took, the original whitepapers, and looked at how others had implemented the same architecture in order to better understand how StyleGan worked. 

### Whitepapers:
- [A Style-Based Generator Architecture for Generative Adversarial Networks](https://arxiv.org/abs/1812.04948)
  - [Official Implementation](https://github.com/tkarras/progressive_growing_of_gans)
- [Progressive Growing of GANs for Improved Quality, Stability, and Variation](https://arxiv.org/abs/1710.10196)
  - [Official Implementation](https://github.com/NVlabs/stylegan)


### Datasets:
- [Anime Profile Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/prasoonkottarathil/gananime-lite)
- [Abstract Art Dataset](https://www.kaggle.com/bryanb/abstract-art-gallery)
